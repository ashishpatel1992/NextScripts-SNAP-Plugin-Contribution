Source code https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/
## Overview
This repository contains my open-source contribution to the NextScripts Social Networks Auto-Poster (SNAP) plugin for WordPress. The plugin, which automates posting to social media, has not been maintained for several years, leading to compatibility issues with modern WordPress and database systems.
Issues Addressed
I encountered multiple database-related errors with the plugin (version 4.4.6) on WordPress 6.7.0 and MariaDB 10.6.22, including:

- SQL syntax errors due to incorrect table quoting (e.g., single quotes around table names like 'wp_nxs_log' and 'wp_nxs_query').
- Missing or unrecognized id column in the wp_nxs_query table, causing errors like Unknown column 'id' in 'SELECT'.

These issues were resolved by updating the plugin's PHP code to:

- Use backticks (`) for table names in SQL queries.
- Ensure proper table schema creation for wp_nxs_log and wp_nxs_query.
- Implement error handling and email notifications for database errors using wp_mail.

## Changelog
### Version 4.4.6-patch1 (June 12, 2025)
- **Fixed SQL Syntax Errors**: Updated queries in `nxs_do_this_hourly` and `nxs_checkQuery` to use backticks (`` ` ``) instead of single quotes for table names (`wp_nxs_log`, `wp_nxs_query`), resolving MariaDB 10.6.22 compatibility issues.
- **Fixed Missing `id` Column**: Ensured `wp_nxs_query` table schema includes the `id` column, fixing `Unknown column 'id'` errors.
- **Added Email Notifications**: Implemented `nxs_send_error_email` function to send `wp_mail` notifications for database errors, using SNAPâ€™s existing email settings.
